# Chinese Solitaire
My WWDC 2017 submission

This is my WWDC 2017 submission, I made a game of Chines Solitare. 

The game is easy to play, just press any of the filled cells (red) and jump over another filled cell into an empty cell (white). To make it a bit more clear what cell you took the pawn from, that cell will turn purple. The goal is to be left with only 1 pawn and have it in the center of the board (the cell that’s empty when the game starts). More likely however, is that at some point it’s impossible to jump over another pawn and you’ll be stuck. When that happens, you “lost” the game and you can try again. Also, if you beat the game, you can of course try again.
